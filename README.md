### Full description:
FoodHax is more than a traditional macro tracker. It is not limited to tracking specific individual items, it allows for the tracking of recipes as well. This makes it easy for users to use. It also has the additional feature of allowing users to create their own recipes. This makes tracking repeated items easy. All nutritional information is provided through the FatSecret API. There are no special permissions required. 


## Thoughs and Reflection

Turned out pretty great for a first attempt at an app. Definitely planning to revisit this idea in the future. Initially was told to select a project with a smaller scope. Even though I did not finish, I am glad to have worked on something that pushed my technical skills as well as my time-management.
